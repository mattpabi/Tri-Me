The mathematical degrees symbol, indicated by ° in the code, may not be displayed in the command line of older operating system versions.
As a result, the command line may output a rectangular symbol resembling ▯.

If it does output as ▯, please ignore it and treat it as if it was the degrees symbol °. If not, then you can ignore this text file.

Have fun.
